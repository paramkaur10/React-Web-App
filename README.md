# React-Web-App
The website is made using React. I built it using Pycharm. React Web App, is a single page application that fetches data from Google news API.
I created a simple single page blog static website.
● The page has a 2-column layout
● I included 3 blog posts in the “Main” sections of the page.
The post includes the following:
■ Title: it is a working link that goes to the page that displays the whole blog post.
■ Date (of the post)
It also includes the summary of the blog post and includes an image and text.
The “Nav” section includes a link that goes to the homepage of the blog page.
Instructions:
Download the src for React web app file which contains all the source code for the React web applicaton. In the terminal of the compiler type 'npm install --g create-react-app which will download the React web application.
After completion of the previos step, type npm start.
In the React folder, replace the src folder with the src folder just downloaded. 
Enjoy!!!
